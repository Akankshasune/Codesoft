                    <p>Hello,, Akshu Here . I am pursuing my M.Sc degree in Computer Science at GSG College UKD, where I'm learning theoretical and practical aspects of Software And Web-Devlopment.
                        I’ve always been interested in tech. I like to explore as many things as possible and I am curious to learn new things and apply that knowledge.
                        Currently honing my skills through rigorous coursework and hands-on projects. Eager to contribute my analytical prower and innovative mindset to the ever-evolving landscape of CS.
                        Let's connect and explore the limitless possibilities at the intersection of technology and intelligence.</p>

                        <h3>Specch_Emotion_Recognization Usnig Python</h3><br>
                        <p> A AI ML BASED ,
                            In this developing world of AI, we have a Speech Emotion Recognition system to
                            support the daily task of a working professional. It comes with its own pros and
                            cons which have been also discussed in this project. It is easy to develop yet very
                            easy to use and will develop more in the coming times. It is one more step ahead in
                            the field of technology to understand human emotion and its behaviors.
                            Emotion-sensing technologies can help employees make better decisions, improve their
                            focus and performance in the workplace, manage stress, and help them adopt healthier
                            and more productive working styles. Emotion-sensing technology will also enable
                            companies to establish deeper emotional connections with their consumers through
                            virtual assistants. Data collected through such devices can help companies
                            understand how internal and external environmental factors impact their employees.
                            As a result, companies can redesign processes accordingly, to help keep their
                            personnel better engaged and productive.
                            Speech recognition relies upon “feature analysis,” which is “speaker independent”.
                            This method processes voice input using phonetic unit recognition and finds
                            similarities between expected inputs and the actual digitized voice input. Simply
                            put, it matches a user’s speech to generic voice patterns. Highly accurate
                            speaker-independent speech recognition is challenging to achieve as accents,
                            inflections, and different languages thwart the process. An example of speech
                            recognition technology in use is speech-to-text platforms such as Speech Matics or
                            Google’s speech-to-text engine. In addition, many voice assistants offer
                            speech-to-text translation.
